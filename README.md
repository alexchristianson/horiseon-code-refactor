# Horiseon-code-refactor

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to refactor the Horiseon Social Solutions Services webpage to meet accessibility standards. This will allow more people to have meaningful access to the page and also optimize the page for search engines.

## What I Did
* Added semantic HTML elements
* Added descriptive title
* Added alt attributes to images
* Added missing id to fix menu link
* Added comments to index.html and style.css for clarity
* Cleaned up CSS to remove repetitive code
* Organized CSS so related code is sectioned together
* Changed h2 tag in footer to h3 to follow order
